          <h3>Sports & Growth</h3>
          <p>I really enjoy improving my habits and the quality of my life. It's quite interesting to look back sometimes and notice how far of a road you've come. Sports has helped me with this journey a lot and allowed my mind and body to develop itself a lot more. I absolutely love lifting more heavy weights and learning myself to do all those crazy movements and pushing myself to the absolute limits of my physical abilitiesü¶æ.</p>

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I absolutely love coding - there's something magical about turning abstract ideas into living, breathing software that can change people's lives. For me, coding isn't just about writing lines of code; it's about creating something from nothing, solving complex puzzles, and watching my imagination materialize into reality.</p>

          <h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
          <p>Like countless readers before me, I've fallen irrevocably under the enchantment of Middle-earth. There's something uniquely captivating about Tolkien's masterpiece that transcends mere storytelling ‚Äì the way he weaves together ancient languages, mythological depth, and timeless themes creates a world so vivid and immersive that it feels almost tangible.</p>

          <h3>The Witcher</h3>
          <p>I am absolutely passionate about The Witcher franchise - its deep storytelling, complex characters, and rich world-building have completely captured my imagination. From the original books by Andrzej Sapkowski to the critically acclaimed video games, particularly The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, every iteration brings something unique and compelling to the table. What draws me in is how the series masterfully balances dark fantasy elements with sophisticated social commentary, exploring themes of prejudice, destiny, and human nature through Geralt's morally ambiguous lens.  </p>

          <h3>Dragon Ball</h3>
          <p>Dragon Ball isn't just an anime series to me - it's a defining force that has shaped countless memories and continues to fuel my passion for adventure and self-improvement. From the epic battles that left me breathless to the inspiring transformations that sparked my imagination, every moment of this legendary saga has left an indelible mark on my heart. </p>
