<h1>The best movies(subjective list)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>This is the greatest movie of all time in my personal opinion. <br /> It has one-of-a-kind cast, great soundtrack, interesting plot, lots of epic and dramatic scenes. <br /> It keeps the viewer engaged and at the edge of his seat the whole time. <br /> I could put each and every one of LOTR movies on this list but it would have been boring, I think.</p>

<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>What can I say what hasn't been said about this movie? <br /> It is truly great.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>"I'm gonna make this pencil disappear" *grabs the guy by the head and slams it onto the pencil, which pierces the guy's eye* "Tadaaaa! Its gone :)"</p>
